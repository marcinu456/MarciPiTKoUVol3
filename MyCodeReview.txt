The file structure is completely disintegrated and thus unreadable. 
It needs to be split into appropriate subfolders, e.g. everything related to GAS should digest
 into the GAS Folder, and then split into further subfolders when the C++ 
 side of the system grows in time. The same is true for BluePrints where there 
 is total chaos and there are still folders from the startup project. 
 To start with, it is also best to separate things from the marketplace so that 
 they do not mix with those created by the team. And, as in C++, all 
 BPs from a given topic should go into the appropriate subfolders.
